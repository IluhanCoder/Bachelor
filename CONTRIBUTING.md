## üíª Development Workflow

### Running the Application

Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm start

3. Ensure code follows style guidelines
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork
6. Create a Pull Request

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Use clear, descriptive names
const calculateTotalStoryPoints = (tasks: TaskResponse[]): number => {
  return tasks.reduce((sum, task) => sum + getStoryPoints(task.difficulty), 0);
}

// ‚ùå Bad - Unclear abbreviations
const calcSP = (t: any): number => {
  return t.reduce((s, x) => s + gSP(x.diff), 0);
}
```

**Rules:**
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Add types to all function parameters and returns
- Use meaningful variable names (no `x`, `temp`, `data` without context)
- Extract magic numbers to named constants

### React Components

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good - Functional component with props interface
interface TaskCardProps {
  task: TaskResponse;
  onStatusChange: (taskId: string, newStatus: string) => void;
}

const TaskCard: React.FC<TaskCardProps> = ({ task, onStatusChange }) => {
  // Component logic
  return (
    <div className="task-card">
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default TaskCard;
```

**Rules:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Define props interface above component
- Extract complex logic to custom hooks
- Keep components under 200 lines (extract if larger)
- One component per file (except small helper components)

### File Naming

```
‚úÖ Good:
task-service.ts
TaskCard.tsx
quick-stats-cards.tsx
useProjectData.ts

‚ùå Bad:
TaskService.ts
taskcard.tsx
QuickStatsCards.tsx
projectData.ts
```

**Rules:**
- React components: PascalCase.tsx
- Services/utilities: kebab-case.ts
- Hooks: camelCase starting with 'use'
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Comments

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Explain WHY, not WHAT
// Calculate velocity using last 10 sprints to avoid skewing from early project phases
const recentSprints = allSprints.slice(-10);

// ‚úÖ Good - Document complex business logic
/**
 * Three-tier permission check:
 * 1. Project owner has full access
 * 2. Participant with specific right
 * 3. Task creator (if they have create right)
 */
async canUserEditTask(taskId: string, userId: string) { ... }

// ‚ùå Bad - Stating the obvious
// Loop through tasks
tasks.forEach(task => { ... })
```
