# üéØ Backlogger - Project Presentation

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

**"Backlogger is an Agile project management platform I built from scratch that helps software teams plan sprints, track Story Points, and analyze productivity. Unlike generic PM tools, it features a 9-level granular permission system for complex team structures, ML-based predictive analytics, and real-time velocity tracking. Built with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB - it demonstrates full-stack architecture, complex data aggregations, and modern UI/UX design."**

## üé§ 2-Minute Demo Script

### Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi! I'm Illia, and I'd like to show you Backlogger - a project management system I developed to help Agile teams collaborate more effectively."

### Problem Statement (20 seconds)
"Many teams struggle with sprint planning because they lack visibility into:
- Team capacity and velocity
- Task distribution across team members
- Historical performance trends
- Granular access control for complex organizations"

### Solution Overview (30 seconds)
"Backlogger solves this with:
1. **Story Points System** - Automatic calculation based on difficulty (1, 3, or 5 points)
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Velocity charts, top contributors, predictive modeling
3. **Flexible Permissions** - 9 different rights that can be mixed and matched per user
4. **Kanban Board** - Visual sprint management with To Do, In Progress, Done columns"

### Technical Highlights (30 seconds)
"From a technical perspective:
- Full TypeScript stack for type safety
- MongoDB aggregation pipelines for complex analytics queries
- MobX for efficient state management
- Recharts for data visualization
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- ML regression for predicting future sprint completion"

### Live Demo (20 seconds)
"Let me show you quickly..." *(Navigate through key features)*
- Create a project
- Plan a sprint with dates
- Add tasks with Story Points
- View analytics dashboard
- Check velocity chart and top contributors

### Closing (15 seconds)
"This project demonstrates my full-stack capabilities, system architecture design, and ability to build production-ready applications. The code is on GitHub with comprehensive documentation. Happy to answer questions!"

## üìù Interview Talking Points

### If Asked: "Tell me about this project"

**Structure:**
1. **Problem** - "Teams need better sprint planning tools with visibility"
2. **Solution** - "I built a full-stack PM system with analytics"
3. **Technical** - "Used TypeScript, React, Node, MongoDB"
4. **Challenge** - "The permission system was complex - 9 different rights with 3-tier validation"
5. **Learning** - "Improved my skills in aggregation pipelines and state management"
6. **Result** - "Production-ready application with comprehensive documentation"

### If Asked: "What was the biggest challenge?"

**Answer:**
"The analytics system. Specifically, calculating historical task creation vs completion rates. I needed to:
- Iterate through date ranges day-by-day
- Handle month/year boundaries correctly
- Distinguish between 'created on exact date' vs 'created by cumulative date'
- Optimize MongoDB queries with proper indexes

The solution involved creating separate condition functions and rewriting the date iteration logic to use JavaScript Date objects properly, which taught me a lot about date handling and query optimization."

### If Asked: "How does the permission system work?"

**Answer:**
"It's a three-tier validation system:
1. Project **Owner** has full access to everything
2. **Custom Rights** - 9 granular permissions assigned per user
3. **Creator Rights** - Users can always edit/delete their own tasks

This runs on every operation at the service layer before database mutations. It's similar to how enterprise systems like Jira handle permissions, but I designed it to be more flexible for small teams."

### If Asked: "Why MongoDB instead of SQL?"

**Answer:**
"A few reasons:
1. **Flexible Schema** - Requirements like permissions evolved during development
2. **Nested Documents** - Participants and rights naturally fit as embedded arrays
3. **Aggregation Pipelines** - Powerful for analytics calculations
4. **JSON-like Structure** - Works naturally with TypeScript interfaces

However, I used proper indexes and followed schema-like patterns with Mongoose to maintain data integrity."

### If Asked: "Would you do anything differently?"

**Answer:**
"Yes, several things:
1. **Testing** - Add Jest for unit tests and Cypress for E2E
2. **WebSockets** - Real-time updates for task status changes
3. **File Storage** - Use S3 instead of base64 for avatars
4. **Pagination** - Current task lists could slow with 1000+ tasks
5. **Caching** - Redis for frequently accessed data like permissions

These would be my next priorities if scaling to production."
